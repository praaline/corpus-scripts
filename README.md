# Praaline Corpus Processing Scripts in Python

This repository contains scripts written in Python with PraalinePy, that can be used to process and import into Praaline  several publicly-available spoken language and multimodal corpora.

Language corpora are distributed under various formats. While Praaline has extensive support for importing different file formats, as well as metadata and annotations, some additional pre-processing if often needed. Python scripts that import PraalinePy (i.e. the Python bindings to Praaline's core libraries) can be used to do this pre-processing effectively.
